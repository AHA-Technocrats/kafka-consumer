# Setting Up and Configuring the WebSocket Server:
# Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install in your project directory.
# WebSocket Server Code:

Use the provided Node.js code for the WebSocket server. Save the code in a file named server.js.
# Kafka Configuration:

Make sure your Kafka server is running and accessible at localhost:9092.
Ensure that the topic(s) you want to subscribe to exist in your Kafka cluster.
# Run the WebSocket Server:

Execute the WebSocket server code by running node server.js in your terminal.
The WebSocket server will start listening on port 4000 by default.
# Testing Multiple Clients with Multiple Topics:
# Connecting Clients:

Open multiple terminal windows or tabs to simulate multiple clients.
Connect to the WebSocket server using WebSocket clients with different query parameters to subscribe to different topics.
Example command to connect a client to subscribe to topic1:
arduino
Copy code
wscat -c "ws://localhost:4000/test?topics=topic1"
Subscribing to Different Topics:

Connect clients with different query parameters to subscribe to different topics of interest.
For example, you can connect one client to topic1, another client to topic2, and so on.
# Sending Messages to Kafka:

Produce messages to the Kafka topics that clients are subscribed to. You can use Kafka command-line tools (kafka-console-producer) to publish messages to topics.
Example command to produce a message to topic1:
css
Copy code
kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic topic1
Observing Client Responses:

Observe the messages received by each WebSocket client based on the topics they subscribed to.
Each client should only receive messages from the topics they have subscribed to.
Additional Notes:
Ensure that your Kafka server is properly configured and running without errors.
Monitor the WebSocket server logs for any connection errors or message processing failures.
Adjust the WebSocket server code and Kafka configuration as needed based on your specific requirements and environment.
By following these instructions, you should be able to set up, configure, and run the WebSocket server and test multiple clients with multiple topics of interest effectively
